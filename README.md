# my-personal-secret-diary
little console program to encrypt your diary.

# Purpose of this little project
First thing you have to know it's console programm<br/>


Yeah, if you are Windows OS user and you don't have modern terminal,<br/>
than you better get one of these. It's free and better than weird cmd.exe.<br/>
Also using this application you may have problems, because cmd.exe does not support<br/>
scrolling. But it is required with programm.


I made this app as my first step to world of Golang.<br/>
I haven't become the wisest master of Golang, but i got good knowledge</br>
Anyway it's still good to keep your diary encrypted, hidden from another people.<br/>

# Commands
help -> to see help<br/>
open -> to open existing diary<br/>
add  -> to add a page to existing diary<br/>
make -> to make a new diary<br/>
read -> to read a diary<br/>



So, if you want to create diary, go to https://allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx<br/>
and get your encryption key! Next session, you would like to enter previous key again, unless you want to work with<br/>
another diary.
